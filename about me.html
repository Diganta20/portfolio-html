<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m a Computer Engineering graduate from Indus University, Ahmedabad (Class of 2025), with a CGPA of 8.61/10. <br>
  <p> I’m a driven technologist with a deep curiosity for how software, data, and intelligent systems can solve real-world problems and scale meaningful impact.

My technical skill set spans Python, Data Science, IoT, and full-stack web development — with a growing focus on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and Generative AI.</p>
 <p></p> I enjoy creating end-to-end solutions that are not only functional and performant but also user-centric and visually compelling.

During my journey, I completed a hands-on web development internship with Prodigy Infotech, where I sharpened my front-end and back-end development capabilities.<br> I’m currently investing my time in building intelligent, interactive web apps using React and integrating modern AI capabilities using tools like OpenAI APIs and LangChain — preparing myself for roles that sit at the intersection of software engineering and innovation.</p>

I'm actively working toward becoming a top-tier Software Development Engineer (SDE) and contributing to high-impact teams at companies like Amazon, Google, or AI-focused startups. At the same time, I’m nurturing my entrepreneurial ambitions with a long-term goal to build a billion-dollar tech-driven business by 2030 — one that blends vision, design, and utility at scale.

<p>Beyond coding, I’m deeply focused on personal growth — building confidence, improving my fitness, and becoming more self-aware. I believe in disciplined learning, bold execution, and surrounding myself with people and projects that inspire me to grow.

<p>Let’s connect if you're building something exciting — or if you're just passionate about tech, startups, and the future of AI.</p>
